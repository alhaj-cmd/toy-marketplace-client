**Components: React components are the building blocks of the user interface. They can be functional components (simple functions) or class components (ES6 classes). Components define the structure, behavior, and appearance of different parts of the UI.

**JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. It enables you to define the structure of React components in a more declarative manner.

**State: React components can have state, which represents the data and the current state of the component. The state can be updated, triggering a re-render of the component and its child components.

**Props: Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to its child components. Props are read-only and help in maintaining the flow of data between components.

**Lifecycle methods: React components have lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into different phases of a component's life, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting. These methods provide opportunities to perform certain actions or handle events during different stages of a component's existence.

**Routing: React projects often involve managing routing within the application. React Router is a popular library used for handling routing in React applications, allowing for navigation between different pages or views.

**State management: As React projects grow in complexity, managing application state becomes important. Redux and MobX are commonly used libraries for managing state in React applications.

**API integration: React projects often involve integrating with backend APIs to fetch and update data. This can be done using libraries like Axios or the built-in fetch API.
